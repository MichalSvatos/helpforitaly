My girlfriend is Italian, shortly after we met Italy became my second home. Most of my friends live there and it‚Äôs a struggle to see the situation that the Country is facing. In the Czech Republic, my home Country, many talented and smart people are working hard to help and make a difference. That‚Äôs why I decided to create this website, it‚Äôs the least I can do to repay for what Italy did for me.</p> <p>And before someone tell me that those and those needs help too. Yes, of course. Everyone needs help for different reasons. But expressing support to one group, doesn't mean disinterest in others.</p> </section> <footer> <p> <span id="js-current-year"></span>, Coded by <a href="https://twitter.com/MichalSvatos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@MichalSvatos</a> with ‚ù§Ô∏è for üáÆüáπItaly <br> Edited buoy icon by <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/deasigner_jae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dea Jae</a> </p> </footer>
